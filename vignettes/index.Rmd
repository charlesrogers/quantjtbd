#### Caveat
_As of Monday, January 29th, 2024, I neither really know how to code nor make R packages. However that is not a prerequisite to making a package, so here we go.
This package is for me, Charles Rogers, in my work as a mixed methods User Experience researcher._

## Get Your Data Ready

To be honest, the hardest part of this package is getting the data in a format that the package can accept. 

### Load the data

Load the data (ideally via SPSS) because we want to use the column labels in the graphics

### Format the data

To get this beast of a function to work, your jobs columns must follow the following format:

```{r eval=FALSE}
"imp__" + "job section" + "." + "job" 
# Example: imp__job_step_1.minimize_time_to_do_something
"sat__" + "job section" + "." + "job" 
# Example:sat__job_step_1.minimize_time_to_do_something
```

A few other rules:

* Job names must be DISTINCT  
* You must have an importance and satisfaction column for every job you want to calculate  
* 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Using the Package

```{r}
library(quantjtbd)
```

```{r }

```

## Sample Workflow

### Import your SPSS data into R

```{r}

# df_spss  <-  haven::read_sav("YOUR_FILE.sav")
# Check out the data and their labels via the Labeled package's Dictionary functionality
# dictionary <- labelled::generate_dictionary(df_spss)
```
